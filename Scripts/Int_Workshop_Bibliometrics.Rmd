# Introduction

-   This section will provide an overview of bibliometrics and the
    importance of bibliometric analysis.

-   Search in the Web of Science and Scopus platforms.

-   Identify different tools but focusing on R programming language.

# What is Bibliometrics?

Following @donthu2021, @ellegaard2015, @Aria2017, and @bornmann2015
bibliometric analysis:

-   Is a methodology that applies quantitative techniques to
    bibliographic data and plays a vital role in evaluating research
    output.
-   This technique allows researchers to uncover emerging trends
    identifying knowledge gaps in specific domains and analyze a
    significant quantity of documents .
-   It offers three types of analysis: performance analysis, science
    mapping, and network analysis.

# Types of Analysis I

## Performance Analysis

# Types of Analysis II

## Science Mapping

# Types of Analysis III

## Network Analysis

# Why is it important?

-   Identifying Relevant Literature
-   Assessing Research Impact
-   Understanding Research Trends and Relationships
-   Choosing Where to Publish
-   Choosing Where to Do Research

# Limitations

-   Citations bias

-   Bibliometrics does not replace in-depth reading the literature

-   The Mathew effect

# The role of digital platforms I

## Digital libraries

# The Web of Science and Scopus

-   Integrating Web of Science and Scopus databases is complex and
    requires a structured workflow, as pointed out by @echchakoui2020
    and @caputo2022.

-   Merging these databases can help mitigate resource bias in research.
    However, other biases such as retrieval bias and medium bias may
    persist.

# Hands-On The Data

Please open the [University of Urbino Website](https://www.uniurb.it/)
and enter with your credentials to the Web of Science and Scopus
platforms.
